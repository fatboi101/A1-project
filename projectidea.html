    <p>My IT project idea is a <strong>2D platforming videogame</strong>, like <em>Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Super Meat Boy,</em> or <em>Ori and the Blind Forest</em>, but with speed running elements.  Like these games you would control a character in a 2D plane and go through levels while overcoming obstacles and enemies but will have more movement options and interesting level designs. The project would be created using basic programming and game creation engines such as <em>unity</em> or <em>unreal engine</em>, while the assets like the characters and enemies would be made with simple pixel art in <em>Adobe Photoshop</em> or <em>Microsoft Paint</em>.</p>
    <p>While there are many platforming games out there, there haven’t been many new innovative ones, instead many game developers have been creating more action, shooter, or RPG games. There are only a few which combine the features of speed running and platforming in the foundation of the game. This game will appeal to both the hardcore gamers through its speed running aspects, while it can also appeal to casual gamers as they can just ignore those aspects. This project will quell the boredom of people looking to play platforming games but also want something new from the genre.</p>

    <p>The project is a <strong>speed running-platforming game hybrid</strong>, based on other high paced games such as <em>Super Meat Boy</em>. The idea is to have smooth and fluid movement options chaining together to create a quick, precise, and satisfying experience when completing a level. Each level will have a timer at the top, starting at the beginning of the level, and ending the second it is completed. After the level is completed an online leader board is shown of all the times of other players and their times taken to complete the level. Moreover, after all the levels are completed the completion times of all the previous levels are added together to get a total, with it being shown at the end as “Total Completion Time”, this will also be shown on the online leader board. The movement options that are given in this game will include the generic options that other games have, such as walking, running, jumping, and double jumping. There will be other unique movement options such as an option to dash in the air in any direction as one of the core mechanics. Dashing towards the ground though, would cause the character to keep its momentum and slide on the ground, allowing for quick and fluid transitioning from aerial and grounded movement. This will be the main way for players to manoeuvre around the level quicker than last time, with their skill with the technique improving as they play. This mechanic is based on a technique, the “wavedash” using an air dodge in <em>Super Smash Brothers Melee</em>, a game created for the <em>Nintendo Gamecube</em> in 2001. The physics engine must be adjusted precisely to ensure that everything works correctly, and that there aren’t any bugs in the system relating to the movement. Similar to <em>Super Mario</em>, the levels in the game will be segregated into “worlds”, where there will be several maps to play on in each world. Each of these worlds will introduce new gimmicks to the player exclusive to their world and further the story of the game. Each of the levels in these worlds will contain these gimmicks and is designed based on the aesthetics of the world. An example of this could be an icy world, where all the levels would have obstacles, you would find in a frozen area such as icicles and slippery surfaces. Another world could be a jungle type world where you would swing on rope-like vines and carnivorous plant like enemies. These worlds and levels will keep the game fresh to the player, slowly introducing new mechanics to the player to keep them interested in the game.</p>

    <p>Things that the game would include would be <strong>story, audio, assets, levels,</strong> and <strong>gameplay mechanics</strong> . All these things could be done on a computer, using the appropriate programs. The story could be written in any text application such as Microsoft word, while the assets and levels could be designed in <em>Adobe Photoshop</em> or <em>Microsoft Paint</em>. The audio could be made using a simple online music maker, while the gameplay mechanics would have to be created through game maker engines such as <em>unreal engine</em>, <em>unity</em>, or <em>game maker studio</em>. </p>
    <p>For this project there needs to be a <strong>wide range of skills required</strong>. There needs to be good writing skills for the story of the game and a musician for the sound effects and music in the game. Proficiency in <em>Adobe Photoshop</em> or another program will also be required for the game assets and the art style. Skills to design many interesting levels and worlds, and skilled programming and familiarity with game maker engines to implement the game mechanics and bring all those together. Most of these can be obtained online for free or have free alternatives, while the skills can be learnt throughout the creation of the game</p>
    <p>If this project is successful and implemented correctly, there will be less people bored by having an interesting new game to play. The development would hopefully innovate other game developers to introduce new mechanics and experimenting the combination of other genres together to provide more entertainment to the market.</p>
