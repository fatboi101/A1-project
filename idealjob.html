    <p>As a <strong>Systems administrator</strong>, you must be responsible for the configuration and maintenance of the network and computer systems of an organisation. This is appeals to me as you need good problem-solving skills and good knowledge and experience with many programs and technologies to work well. Jobs for <strong>Systems administrator</strong>s are expected to grow 19.8% by 2025, meaning that it wouldnâ€™t be too hard to get a job as a system administrator. This job offer for AMES Australia is appealing to me as it is a full-time job, also allowing for working at home meaning the work hours can be flexible. When not working from home, the office is in same suburb, allowing for very short travel times, both factors allow for an excellent work life balance. There are several benefits included in this job such as the health and well-being program, and the employee recognition program, showing that the management is concerned with the mental health of their employees and wanting them to feel comfortable at work. The pay in the job is good as it is $70K plus superannuation. Due to the variance of skills needed to work, the good work life balance, a healthy working environment, and decent pay, this is my ideal job.</p>

    <p>A <strong>Systems administrator</strong> needs to provide an impactful and methodical service to both employees and clients. The qualifications needed for the job are any tertiary qualification in computer science, IT or any other related field. The skills needed for the job are good problem-solving skills, ability to communicate well, time management skills, good writing skills for documentation, and work while being professional, reliable, and consistent. It also requires a vast knowledge and experience in various technologies and programs. It requires both knowledge and experience in administering <strong>SQL</strong> <em>(Structured Query Language)</em> servers and understanding of relational databases, experience in working with <em>computer networks, internet gateways, MS windows,</em> and other <em>Open-Source platforms</em>. This position requires vast array of skills and experiences in many programs and technologies to be considered.</p>

    <p>Currently I only have basic knowledge and experience in many fields. Despite have proficiency for <em>Microsoft office </em> applications, I only have basic knowledge in databases only learning about <em>SQL</em> and <em>relational databases</em> recently. The other programs needed to be considered for the position I have little to no knowledge and experience about and will have to obtain them in the future. Currently the skills that I have are good problem-solving skills, ability to work under time constraints, and ability to work well in a team. I am not too confident in my ability to work professionally and consistently, and my ability to write coherently for documentation.</p>
    <p>I will obtain most of these skills during my time in tertiary education in <em>RMIT</em>, learning all about the programs and technologies needed for the position through the various courses I will complete during the completion of my IT degree. I expect to learn the experience required for administering and solving problems through a different entry level job.</p>
