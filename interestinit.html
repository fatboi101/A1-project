  <p>My interest in IT has started from a very young age, being around computers and playing video games my entire life. Being surrounded by technology has caused me to eventually become interested in how these machines work, why they work, and how they can be useful to people around the world in different scenarios.  Currently my interest in IT lies in the security aspect of it, how to keep my own information safe and how to also protect companies from hackers and other virtual attacks. I am also interested with the vast number of programs and technologies that are currently being used and want to help further the use of IT services and products in the world.</p>
  <p>The event that sparked my interest in pursuing <em>Information Technology</em> is the lack of motivation to continue my previous course of Science at <em>RMIT</em>. This caused me to research other possible courses to transfer into and to revaluate what I wanted to do in the future. The Bachelor of IT at <em>RMIT</em> was the first preference in what I wanted to do after dropping my previous course. My IT experience has only been through a robotics subject, and a game development subject in High School. Most of the things that I have learnt were forgotten though.</p>
  <p>I chose to come to <em>RMIT</em> because <em>RMIT</em> is a prestigious university that provides great education and has good connections with businesses allowing for a good career pathway. The fact that <em>RMIT</em>â€™s campuses and facilities are inside the city and around the CBD, allows for me to get accustomed to life around the city once I get a job. I had also previously enrolled into <em>RMIT</em> from my previous course and therefore have already grown accustomed to the system that <em>RMIT</em> uses. </p>
  <p>During my studies of <em>Information Technology at RMIT</em> I expect to learn skills such as building web pages, building software systems, and solving software and hardware issues. I also expect to learn basic programming languages such as <em>C++</em> and <em>Python</em>. Depending on what I choose in the later years, I could also expect learn <strong>advanced programming</strong>, <strong>knowledge of databases</strong>, and learning about <strong>cyber security</strong> and <strong>hacking</strong>. I also expect to learn basic skills such as problem solving, teamwork, organisational skills, and communication skills during my studies through the various individual or group assignments given throughout my tertiary education at <em>RMIT</em>.</p>
