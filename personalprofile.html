    <p>The result of my personality test is that I am a <strong>Virtuoso</strong> (ISTP-T, Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving - Turbulent) Virtuosos are described as individualistic people that are logical, realistic, practical, and learns from experience. Doing this test made me understand myself much more, feeling that the result of the personality test strongly correlates with who I am. Learning about my personality type allows to know my strengths and weaknesses, allowing for self-improvement by correcting weaknesses and improving upon strengths. </p>
    <p>The result of my learning style test is that I am mainly a <strong>visual learner</strong> . Learning that I am a visual learner is very interesting. This makes sense as I feel like I learn best when something is shown to me directly, such as someone showing me how to do something, or instructions given through signs and images instead of spoken instructions. I also take notes during class as it helps with memorising information, adding colour and images to further help.</p>
    <p>My big five assessment shows that I have scored high on <strong>openness</strong> ,<strong>agreeableness</strong> , and <strong>neuroticism</strong> but have a scored low on <strong>conscientiousness</strong> and <strong>extraversion</strong>. Scoring high on openness is a for the IT industry as it requires someone to want to be constantly learning, as the industry will constantly change to fit the new technologies. Scoring low on conscientiousness shows that I am disorganised, and impulsive acting without a plan, this can be something that I will work on during my studies at <em>RMIT</em> and ensure that when I enter the workforce I can be depended on.</p>

    <p>These test results have somewhat accurately interpreted my personality, learning style, and big five personality traits, but some of the results I would not agree with. They could have been more accurate with a wider ray of questions asked, but I am still happy with the results given.</p>
    <p>These results show that I am an introvert, with a high score in agreeableness, but low scores on extraversion. This shows that in a group I would be very unlikely to take a leadership role within the group and would tend to agree with what others want. In most group discussions I would stay quiet, only talking when I have a good idea or to agree with another personâ€™s opinion. These results also show that while I would agree with others, I would rather work alone on a separate task to help the group, rather than cooperate with others to complete task. The results show that I am a visual learner as well, meaning that I would work better with tasks to do with analysis and insight.</p>
    <p>Taking this into account the group would have another individual take a leadership role, while I would be someone who mostly listens and does what the group decides. This means that the other members of the group should be more active in group discussions with more opinions. Tasks within the group should be divided between members with certain individuals overseeing different jobs and duties in the group. As a visual learner the task that I should be assigned with should be something that aligns with my strengths. Jobs that I should do within the group should be something that requires analysis or insight.</p>
