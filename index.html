        <p style="font-size: 19px;"> Hi! My name is Richard Lim, 18 years old and a 2020 Highschool Graduate. Currently I am a student at <em>RMIT</em> for the <strong>Bachelor of Information Technology</strong> degree. Both of my parents came from Cambodia, making me a Cambodian Australian. They ended up immigrating to Australia, Victoria as refugees and have been living here ever since. I have two older brothers, and we were all born and raised in Australia.  My main hobby is to play video games, having hundreds of hours in both <em>DOTA2</em> and <em>CS:GO</em>, and having my current favourite games of <em>Tekken 7</em> and <em>Valorant</em>.</p>
